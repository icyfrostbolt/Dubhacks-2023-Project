Project worked on at DubHacks 2023!

## Inspiration

Every book has a different feeling, so every book should have different music. We combine the vastness of the internet in Wikipedia and the power of ChatGPT to create a new playlist for every book you want to read. Jump into literature immersed through both mind and music.

## What it does

We search for your book on Wikipedia, finding a concise summary of the plot. We then feed that to ChatGPT and tell it to generate a playlist based on the plot and keywords of the book. Lastly, that playlist is then parsed and created in your personal Spotify account.

## How we built it

We utilized multiple wrappers and APIs to speed up production, including Spotipy and Flask. APIs used include the Wikipedia API, ChatGPT API, and the Spotify API through Spotipy. We created a website from scratch using HTML and CSS and then used Python for the backend.

## Challenges we ran into
ChatGPT doesn't always give uniform answers every time you ask it the same question, so if the answer wasn't parsable, we had to regenerate the answer. Other challenges included figuring out how to connect our Python code to our website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As first years, we're proud of being able to make a complete project that actually works and we can use for ourselves. We are also proud of being able to do it within the 24 hours given.

## What we learned
We learned how to use multiple APIs, wrappers, and other tools. We also learned our limits, strengths, and things we need to work on for next year.

## What's next for pAIge Sounds
We will eventually open the website for all to use after this competition.
